# Database

The platform uses **PostgreSQL 17** as the primary relational database and **Redis 7** for caching and queues.

## Schema Design

The database schema is organized into logical domains, supporting the clean architecture of the backend services.

- **[Schema Overview](./schema.md)**: Detailed breakdown of tables and relationships.
- **[Migrations](./migrations.md)**: Database version control and migration history.

## Connection

| Environment | Host | Port | Database | User |
|-------------|------|------|----------|------|
| Development | `localhost` | `5432` | `rediver` | `postgres` |
| Docker | `postgres` | `5432` | `rediver` | `postgres` |
| Production | `<managed-db-host>` | `5432` | `rediver` | `<app-user>` |

## Key Concepts

- **Tenancy**: Multi-tenancy is supported via `tenant_id` column in most major entities.
- **Soft Deletes**: Used for `assets` and `findings` to preserve history.
- **UUIDs**: Primary keys are random UUID v4.
- **Audit**: Changes to critical entities are tracked in `audit_logs`.
