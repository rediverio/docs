# 5-Minute Quick Start

Get Rediver CTEM platform running in 5 minutes.

---

## What is Rediver?

Rediver is a **Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)** platform that helps you:

- 🔍 **Discover** assets across repos, cloud, and infrastructure
- 🛡️ **Scan** for vulnerabilities (SAST, SCA, secrets, IaC)
- 📊 **Prioritize** using AI-powered risk scoring
- 🔗 **Integrate** findings from Wiz, Tenable, CrowdStrike, and more

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Docker | 20.10+ |
| Docker Compose | 2.0+ |
| Git | 2.30+ |

---

## Step 1: Clone the Platform

```bash
# Clone the meta-repository
git clone https://github.com/rediverio/rediver-platform.git rediverio
cd rediverio

# Initialize all sub-repositories
make setup
```

This clones API, Agent, UI, and SDK repositories.

---

## Step 2: Start Services

```bash
# Start all services
make up

# Watch logs (optional)
make logs
```

**Services starting:**

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| API | http://localhost:8080 | Backend REST API |
| UI | http://localhost:3000 | Tenant dashboard |
| Admin UI | http://localhost:3001 | Platform admin (optional) |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | Database |
| Redis | localhost:6379 | Cache & queues |

Wait ~30 seconds for all services to be healthy.

## Step 3: Login

**URL:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Default credentials:**
```
Email: admin@rediver.io
Password: Admin123!
```

make logs      # View logs
make restart   # Restart services
make status    # Check health
```
