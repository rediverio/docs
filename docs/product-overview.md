# Rediver CTEM Platform - Product Overview

## What is Rediver?

Rediver is an enterprise-grade **Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)** platform designed to help security teams:

- **Discover** assets across your attack surface
- **Identify** vulnerabilities and security exposures
- **Prioritize** risks based on business impact
- **Validate** with automated scanning
- **Remediate** with tracked workflows

---

## The CTEM Framework

Gartner's CTEM framework provides a systematic approach to managing exposure. Rediver implements all 5 stages:

### Stage 1: Scoping

Define your attack surface boundaries and business context.

**Rediver Features:**
- Asset Groups with business unit assignment
- Crown Jewels identification
- Scope configuration (targets, exclusions)
- Risk thresholds and SLA policies

### Stage 2: Discovery

Automated and continuous discovery of assets and exposures.

**Rediver Features:**
- 6 Asset Types: Domains, Websites, Services, Repositories, Cloud, Credentials
- Workers for distributed scanning
- SCM Connections (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Agent-based continuous discovery

### Stage 3: Prioritization

Rank exposures by risk and business impact.

**Rediver Features:**
- Risk scoring (0-100 scale)
- CVSS-based severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info)
- Asset criticality weighting
- Business context enrichment
- Findings deduplication with fingerprinting

### Stage 4: Validation

Verify vulnerabilities and test security controls.

**Rediver Features:**
- Multi-tool scanning (SAST, SCA, Secrets, IaC, Container)
- Scan Profiles for consistent testing
- Pipeline workflows for multi-step validation
- Scan Sessions for execution tracking

### Stage 5: Mobilization

Remediate and track progress.

**Rediver Features:**
- Remediation task management
- Assignee tracking
- SLA monitoring
- Audit logging
- Status progression (Open → In Progress → Resolved)
