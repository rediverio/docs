## How Permissions Work

1. **Token Generation**: Khi user exchange token cho tenant, role được map thành permissions:
   ```go
   // jwt.go
   permissions := roleToPermissions(tenant.Role)
   
   // role_mapping.go  
   func roleToPermissions(role string) []string {
       r := tenant.Role(role)
       return permission.GetPermissionStringsForRole(r)
   }
   ```

2. **Permission Check**: API routes kiểm tra permission từ token:
   ```go
   // routes.go
   r.GET("/", h.List, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsRead))
   r.POST("/", h.Create, middleware.Require(permission.AssetsWrite))
   ```

3. **Middleware Flow**: 
   ```
   Request → Auth Middleware → Extract permissions from JWT → 
   Require(permission) Middleware → Check HasPermission → Allow/Deny
   ```
